# Teacher Classroom Management

## What it does

This feature gives teachers a full workflow for running a classroom inside Open TutorAI CE:

- Create, edit, and delete classrooms.
- Enroll students three ways: add by email, import a CSV file, or share a join code (a permanent class code or a one-off invite code with optional expiry/usage limits).
- Run live attendance: start a session, students check themselves in by "joining" while the session is open, the teacher can end the session to stop check-ins, and can delete a session afterward.
- Post announcements to a classroom "stream" that enrolled students see.
- Visualize the class as a 3D seating chart (rows, U-shape, or island/group layouts) with each student's avatar; clicking a student shows their personal info and attendance percentages.

## Who uses it

- **Teacher**: owns classrooms, manages enrollment, runs sessions, posts announcements, views attendance stats and per-student history.
- **Student**: joins classrooms via invite/join code, sees their enrolled classrooms, joins live sessions to be marked present, reads announcements.

## How it works

### Classroom and enrollment

A classroom belongs to one teacher (`owner_id`). Students are linked to a classroom through an `Enrollment` row. There are three ways to enroll a student:

1. **Add by email** — the teacher enters an existing student's email; if no account exists, the request fails with a "user not found" error.
2. **CSV import** — a file with `email,name,password` columns. Unknown emails get a new account created (random password if none given); known emails are just enrolled. Rows with no email are skipped and reported.
3. **Join code** — every classroom gets one permanent, non-expiring code (`Invite.is_primary = true`) generated on first view of the classroom detail page. Teachers can also generate additional one-off codes with an expiry date and/or a max number of uses. Students redeem any code through one endpoint; redeeming twice is a no-op (`enrolled: false` the second time).

### Live attendance (sessions)

A session (`ClassSession`) belongs to a classroom and has a subject and free-text objectives, set by the teacher when starting it.

- When a session starts, every enrolled student gets a `Presence` row defaulting to **ABSENT**.
- A student becomes **PRESENT** by calling the "join" endpoint while the session is open. Joining does not downgrade an existing `LATE` status.
- The teacher can manually override any student's status (`PRESENT` / `ABSENT` / `LATE`) at any time.
- The teacher ends a session (`ended_at` is set); once ended, students can no longer join it.
- An ended session can be deleted, which also removes its presence records. A session that hasn't been ended yet cannot be deleted (the API returns a 400).
- Attendance stats (average rate, total absences/lates) and per-student history (rate, last 10 sessions) are computed from the presence records.

### Announcements (classroom stream)

A lightweight post stream scoped to one classroom. Only the owning teacher can post or delete; the teacher and any enrolled student can read. Posts are returned most-recent first.

### 3D seating chart

A Three.js scene rendered client-side from the enrolled student list — no extra data is stored for this. The teacher can switch between three desk layouts (rows, U-shape, islands of four) at any time; switching layouts only rebuilds the desks/avatars, not the whole 3D scene. Each avatar uses the student's real profile photo if one is set, otherwise a color-coded initials avatar (same color scheme used everywhere a student avatar appears). Hovering an avatar shows the student's name; clicking it opens the same student-info popup used elsewhere, showing enrollment date, presence %, and absence %.

## Data involved

| Model | Purpose | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `Classroom` | A teacher's class | `name`, `subject`, `course`, `objectives`, `level`, `description`, `owner_id` |
| `Enrollment` | Links a student to a classroom | `classroom_id`, `student_id`, `enrolled_at` |
| `Invite` | A join code for a classroom | `code`, `classroom_id`, `created_by`, `expires_at`, `max_uses`, `uses`, `is_primary` |
| `ClassSession` | One attendance-taking session | `classroom_id`, `scheduled_at`, `subject`, `objectives`, `auto_recorded`, `ended_at` |
| `Presence` | A student's status for one session | `session_id`, `student_id`, `status` (`PRESENT`/`ABSENT`/`LATE`), `recorded_at` |
| `Announcement` | A post in a classroom's stream | `classroom_id`, `author_id`, `content`, `created_at` |

`User.profile_image_url` (pre-existing field) is now surfaced on the student list and used for avatars; when unset or equal to the generic `/user.png` placeholder, the UI falls back to a colored-initials avatar instead of showing a photo.

## What changed

- **Added**: the entire classroom management domain (classrooms, enrollment, invites, attendance/sessions, announcements, 3D seating chart, student-facing "My Classrooms" page) — none of this existed before.
- **Changed**: `Sidebar.svelte` and `Navbar.svelte` were generalized to work for both the `student` and `teacher` roles instead of being student-only; the student `Dashboard.svelte` "Join Course" popup was wired to the real join-code redemption endpoint instead of a hardcoded stub.
- **Fixed**: a CSV import crash on rows with an empty email (`EmailStr` rejected `""` but not `None`); a class of bugs where repository writes used `session.flush()` instead of `session.commit()`, which silently rolled back outside of the test fixtures' shared session.
